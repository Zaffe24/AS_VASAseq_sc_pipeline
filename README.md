# Alternative Splicing pipeline for VASA-seq
Repository describing the computational workflow employed for the single-cell Alternative Splicing (AS) analysis from [Costea et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.06.24.600391)

## Overview
Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) samples from pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patients were sequenced via VASA-seq, a plate-based total-transcriptome (single-end) scRNA-seq method developed by [Salmen et al., 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-022-01361-8). This repository contains the pipeline, and relative instructions, adapted from the original publication's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/hemberg-lab/VASAseq_2022/tree/main/II_Alternative_splicing) for carrying out the Alternative Splicing (AS) analysis
